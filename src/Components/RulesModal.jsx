                  <p>
                    Now, if price goes down by 200 so the new price is 800. So,
                    you have made a profit in this order of Amount â€“ 100 x 200 =
                    20,000. So, you have received total amount of 1,00,000 +
                    20,000 = 1,20,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another scenario, if price goes up by 200 so the new price
                    is 1200. So, you have made a loss in this order of Amount â€“
                    100 x 200 = 20,000. So, you have received total amount of
                    1,00,000 â€“ 20,000 = 80,000. <br /> The loss will be limited

                <p>
                  A Veto Order Bid works as follows: if multiple teams place a
                  bid on different stocks, the game will check for the highest
                  average buy price of each stock team-wise. If more than one
                  team bids on the same stock, the team with the highest average
                  buy price will win the bid. If the average bid price and total
                  amount is the same for multiple teams, the team with the
                  highest quantity will win the bid.

                In this example, the table shows the bids placed by each team.
                The game will determine the highest average buy price for each
                stock team-wise and if more than one team bids on the same
                stock, the team with the highest average buy price will win the
                bid. If average bid price and total amount is the same for
                multiple teams, the team with the highest quantity will win the
